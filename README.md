### My name is **Clara** and I'm a starting developer from **Brazil**.

:computer: I have been in contact with technology for my entire life, and just recently started deepening my knowledge in the area. Im currently working on learning a lot of **C#**, also having some experience with **Python** applications that came from my college program.  

:cherry_blossom: In my spare time, I love to play games like **Fortnite**, **Valorant** and **The Sims**, but I like to say that I'm the type of person to try anything at least once.

You can checkout my personal website [here](https://claracoliveiras.github.io/), or its less-serious (more friend focused) version [here](https://clawra.moe). Both display what projects I'm currently working on and a few links.

#### For now, I've tried:
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
